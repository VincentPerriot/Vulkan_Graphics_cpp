### How I built the website

#### Initially built following this 26hours Udemy Course
https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-the-vulkan-api-with-cpp/

#### Further updated from different Vulkan tutorials websites
https://vulkan-tutorial.com/

#### Further updated with this excellent Youtube Tutorial playlist from Brendan Galea
https://www.youtube.com/@BrendanGalea/playlists

#### Further udapted with tips from the Graphics Rendering Cookbook from Packt Editions

#### Further updated with Vulkan examples from Sascha Willems

### Lessons and further updates
Adapting many resources helped me understand the in and outs of Vulkan but does not make for great software architecture. This project is now difficult to scale.
Currently working on a new Renderer using the lessons learned here, see Melting Project
